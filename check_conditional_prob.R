#We are now going to write code to compute conditional probabilities for being male in the heights dataset.

library(dslabs)
data("heights")
heights %>% 
  mutate(height = round(height)) %>%
  group_by(height) %>%
  summarize(p = mean(sex == "Male")) %>%
qplot(height, p, data =.)

#In the plot we just made in Q6 we see high variability for low values of height. This is because we have few data points. This time use the quantile  0.1,0.2,â€¦,0.9  and the cut() function to assure each group has the same number of points. Note that for any numeric vector x, you can create groups based on quantiles like this: cut(x, quantile(x, seq(0, 1, 0.1)), include.lowest = TRUE).

ps <- seq(0, 1, 0.1)
heights %>% mutate(g = cut(height, quantile(height, ps), include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(g) %>%
  summarize(p = mean(sex == "Male"), height = mean(height)) %>%
  qplot(height, p, data =.)

#You can generate data from a bivariate normal distrubution using the MASS package using the following code:
Sigma <- 9*matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1), 2, 2)
dat <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = 10000, c(69, 69), Sigma) %>%
  data.frame() %>% setNames(c("x", "y"))

ps <- seq(0, 1, 0.1)
dat %>% mutate(g = cut(x, quantile(x, ps), include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(g) %>%
  summarize(y = mean(y), x = mean(x)) %>% qplot(x, y, data =.)
